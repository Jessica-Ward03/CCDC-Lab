Notes:

Always wrap your component in MemoryRouter if it uses <Link> or <Route>.

Use data-testid to make querying elements easy.

Running the tests
Make sure you have Jest and React Testing Library installed:

npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
In package.json, you should have:

"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
Run the tests:

npm test
It will automatically find files with .test.jsx or .spec.jsx and run them.

You can also run a single test file:

npm test -- Home.test.js

Use data-testid for elements you need to check.
